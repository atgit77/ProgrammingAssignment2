# `makeCacheMatrix`: This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
# `cacheSolve`: computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by `makeCacheMatrix` above. If the inverse has
# already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then `cacheSolve` retrieves the inverse from the cache.

## makeCacheMatrix does the following
#1.  set the value of the matrix
#2.  get the value of the matrix
#3.  set the value of the inverse
#4.  get the value of the inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinv <- function(solve) m <<- solve
  getinv <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinv = setinv,
       getinv = getinv)
}


#The following function calculates the inverse of the special "matrix"
#created with the above function. However, it first checks to see if the
#inverse has already been calculated. If so, it `get`s the inverse from the
#cache and skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of
#the data and sets the inverse of the matrix in the cache via the `setinv`
#function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  
  m <- x$getinv()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinv(m)
  m
}
